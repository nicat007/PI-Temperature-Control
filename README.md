# PI-Temperature-Control
In this project, the aim is to control the temperature of a speciÔ¨Åc point on a circuit board. The temperature will be measured via a thermistor, and the FET transistor will be the heating element. Heat generated by the transistor is transferred to the thermistor by radiation, convection, and conduction. Additionally, a small-sized fan with a continuous voltage input is to be utilized to accomplish a controlled cooling process. The control algorithm is supposed to manipulate the voltages fed to the transistor and the fan to control the temperature sensed by the thermistor.
